# PureHistory
## Content Customization Tool for World of Warships

## NOTE - 11th July 2021
I am discontinuing this project for the time being as I have no interest in the World of Warships Community anymore.
This means I won't provide any updates for game versions or new content anymore.
I am, however, planning to do a last version with full user control so that the program can be rewritten with a simple text editor. After that, I will archive this repository.
