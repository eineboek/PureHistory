4.	Check if the Game version specified in the console application matches the current game version. If not, the mod may not have been updated yet.
5.	Follow the instructions in the console application to install the mod
6.	After the installation, run the game to check if everything works correctly

Note: If youre using the World of Warships ModStation, install this mod after the ModStation, as the ModStation will override any other unknown mods in the folder.
